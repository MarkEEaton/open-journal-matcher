# A journal recommender tool built on the Directory of Open Access Journals

This is a work in progress. The goal is to create a journal recommender to give journal suggestions based on a draft abstract. It still needs work.

The main problem at this point is that it is very slow. The `compare-*.py` files are iterative attempts at addressing the slowness. They still have bugs.

Some systematic profiling of the various solutions to speed up the code needs to be done. Hopefully this can be added soon.
